# TU Delft - Survival Guide

# Migrating to TU Delft as a Student

Migrating to a new country for studies can be a daunting experience, but it can also be one of the most enriching experiences of your life. If you are considering studying at TU Delft, one of the top technical universities in the world, this blog post will guide you through the process of migrating to the Netherlands as a student.

## Preparing for the Move

Before you embark on your journey to TU Delft, there are several things you should do to prepare. First, you should ensure that you have all the necessary documentation, including your passport, student visa, and acceptance letter from TU Delft. You should also research the cost of living in the Netherlands and plan your budget accordingly. Additionally, you may want to learn some basic Dutch phrases to help you navigate your new surroundings.

### **Cost of Living**

[https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/)

Recommended to bring a minimum of 1000€ for first month of living expenses (excluding Rent). Bring 2000€ just in case bank account is not set up within the first month due to delays.

Feel free to use Digital Bank Apps like Revolut or WISE with their MasterCard or VISA Options.

Please note that Albert Heijn (a popular supermarket) is an exception that uses Maestro Card (Get one from Dutch Banks) and do not accept MasterCard or VISA.

## Arriving in the Netherlands

Once you arrive in the Netherlands, you will need to register with the municipality you live in within five days. You will also need to open a Dutch bank account and obtain health insurance.

### Getting Around Netherlands i.e. to Delft by Train

Look at this Map to Travel from Schipol to Delft. Delft is in between Den Haag and Rotterdam.

[The Netherlands by train | Train Tickets & Tours  | HappyRail](https://www.happyrail.com/en/countries/the-netherlands)

### Register With The Municipality You Live In

For example, living in Rijswijk needed me to submit the following documents:

1 - Passport

2 - Signed Rental Contract + Printed Copy of ID (no driving license) of the Landlord

3 - VISA / Residence Permit

4 - Municipal Registration Form

5 - Permission of Landlord Form

You can book at appointment with Klant Contact Centrum (Rijswijk) via [kcc@rijswijk.nl](mailto:kcc@rijswijk.nl)

### Collection of Residence Permit

**1 Golden Word of Advice** - Reach there as early as possible and ignore the appointment time as all universities in Netherlands were queuing in the open at Utrecht to collect their Residence Permit from IND. The queue was insane. You have been warned.

### Bank Account

Open the [ABN AMRO iOS App](https://www.abnamro.nl/nl/prive/internet-en-mobiel/abn-amro-app/index.html) and tap on "Create an Account."

Take a picture of your Passport, followed by your Face.

Enter your tax identification number (BSN) or do so within 120 days.

Choose either personal (Current / Student*) or business account.

Review the terms and conditions, then accept them.

Set up your login credentials, including a username and password.

Finally, confirm your account creation by following the instructions sent to your registered email or phone number.

ABN AMRO will send 4 separate letters by post within 5 working days^:

1 - Your debit card
2 - The PIN for your debit card
3 - The activation code for your debit card
4 - E.dentifier: a device that allows you to log into Internet Banking and confirm orders without smartphone.

* Student Account for ABN AMRO does not allow the usage of Apple Pay.

^There are instances where people have waited for 14 days or more.

*An alternative can be the ING Student Account that can be created via the [ING iOS App](https://www.ing.nl/particulier/student/open-a-student-account). ING claims to have Apple Pay for Student Accounts which may interest you.****

**** ABN AMRO has now allowed student card to be used on Apple Pay as well.*

### Transport - OV-Chipkaart

A personal [OV-Chipkaart](https://www.ov-chipkaart.nl/en/apply-for-personal-ov-chipcard) application costs € 7.50 and is valid for five years.

To save 20% off on all HTM Tram and Train Rides cost on trams and trains provided by HTM, you can buy their [HTM Monthly Pass](https://www.htm.nl/en/webshop/abonnementen/maandkorting) at 3€. Look at the map below to see all the Tram and Train Lines from Delft.

To save 40% off NS Trains during off-peak hours, weekends and public holidays, you can buy their [Dal Voordeel](https://www.ns.nl/en/nsflex/webshop#/abonnement/dal-voordeel) at 2.50€.

Refer to HTM Tram and Bus Map Below.

Things to Note Prior to Purchase

1 - There are bicycles that only have **reverse paddle brakes** ie braking by paddling backwards. For inexperienced cyclists, it will be good to buy a second-hand bicycle with at least one hand brake.

2 - The law states that cycling at night requires a **front light** (WHITE LED) and a **rear light** (RED LED).

3 - A **rear lock** designed bicycle to lock the rear wheel is convenient while the second lock is usually a **chain lock** needed to lock the front wheel and frame to bicycle stands during parking.

4 - **Fenders** are necessary to prevent rain from splashing upwards and wetting your clothes.

5 - **Racks** for Front and Rear are convenient to cable tie a Bicycle Crate.

6 - A **single chain** bicycle with no option to change gears is good for maintenance and is less prone to breaking down. Parking bicycle under shelter also minimises contact with rainwater that causes rust to form.

7 - A Second-Hand City Bicycle with features mentioned above cost 150€ as observed during Introduction Week organised by University. The contact is here - Laan van Waalhaven 213a 2497 GL Den Haag Ypenburg in Kringloop Rataplan | reparatie@op-nieuw.nl | www.op-nieuw.nl

8 - Cost of Accessories - [Bicycle Crate from Aldi](https://www.aldi.nl/aanbiedingen/WK34_Vanaf_Woensdag_23-08/fietskrat-2011297-1-0.article.html) (8.99€) | [Bicycle Bell from SoLow](https://solow.nl/) (2€) | [Bicycle Pump from Action](https://www.action.com/nl-nl/p/2561081/fietspomp/) (6.98€).

9 - Final note is that the [image](https://angelcruisers.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-2022-11-17-at-13.03.54.png) shows 28” wheels. A person with a height of 165cm barely steps on the floor. Please ride the bicycle to check level of comfort and safety before buying any bicycle. If you see a huge dent on the chain guard or frame, it is highly recommended not to buy it as it may have been badly abused or damaged.

Rules for Cyclists

1 - Keep to the right side of the road while riding unless overtaking. (Netherlands practises right hand drive). Do not travel in the wrong direction unless certain bicycles are splitted to be bidirectional.
2 - Use hand signals to indicate when turning, stopping, or overtaking. Please look over your shoulders when doing so.
3 - There are signs that prevent parking of bicycles. Furthermore, parking in cities have demarcated painted areas. Do not park them outside the painted box outline as city authorities can confiscate your bicycles by first pasting a warning tag followed by city official movers who load the tagged bicycles.
