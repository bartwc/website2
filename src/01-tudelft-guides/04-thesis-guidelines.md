## Understanding the Thesis Process

### **Thesis Overview**

A thesis at TU Delft typically represents 45 EC (European Credits) and is conducted over 6-9 months. It demonstrates your ability to:
- Conduct independent research
- Apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems
- Analyze and interpret results
- Communicate findings effectively
- Contribute to your field of study

### **Thesis Types**

| Type               | Duration   | Credits  | Focus                             |
|--------------------|------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Research Thesis    | 6-9 months | 45 EC    | Original research contribution    |
| Industry Thesis    | 6-9 months | 45 EC    | Applied research in industry      |

## Pre-Thesis Preparation

### Handle Thesis Admin via MaRe System

[MaRe](https://mare.ewi.tudelft.nl/login) is the official Master Thesis Registration system for all EEMCS MSc programmes at TU Delft. All thesis committee and final examination forms must be submitted via MaRe.

- **Register your thesis project** in MaRe as soon as you start your graduation process.
- MaRe tracks your project progress, sends automated reminders for important deliverables, and simplifies administrative procedures (such as submitting proposals and committee forms).
- **Students** enter project details and submit required forms; 
- **supervisors and support staff** monitor progress and approve milestones.

For more information and official instructions, see the [Master Formulieren page](https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/ewi-studentenportal/onderwijs/formulieren/master-formulieren).

### **Timeline Planning**

**6-9 Months Before Start:**
- Identify potential supervisors and research areas
- Attend thesis information sessions
- Review faculty-specific requirements
- Prepare your CV and motivation letter

**3-4 Months Before Start:**
- Contact potential supervisors
- Discuss research proposals
- Secure funding if required
- Complete necessary paperwork

**1-2 Months Before Start:**
- Finalize supervisor agreement
- Define research scope and objectives
- Set up project timeline
- Prepare workspace and tools

The following timeline is recommended for a 45 EC MSc thesis at TU Delft EEMCS (e.g., Computer Engineering, Telecom, Embedded Systems, Microelectronics) from Start of Thesis:

- **Month 0:** Update your Individual Exam Programme (IEP) and apply for the Thesis Entrance Permit.

## Recommended Digital Repository Structure

To organize your thesis work efficiently, create a OneDrive folder using your TU Delft account, named `Firstname Lastname`. Share the link with your supervisor with full access. Inside, create the following subfolders:

1. **01 administrative**: All thesis-related administration forms. Include a timeline of your thesis (see timeline planning section).
2. **02 literature**: Publications for reference/reading, named in the format (authorYY or authorYY_title).
3. **03 reports**: Your periodic reports, and supervisor's comments/feedback.
4. **04 presentations**: All presentations, posters, and outreach documents.
5. **05 notes**: Meeting notes and records of agreements with your supervisor.
6. **06 code**: Programming code related to your thesis.
7. **07 project**: (If necessary) Documents related to a specific project.

This structure will help you and your supervisor keep all thesis materials organized and accessible throughout your project.

## In-Person Meetings with Supervisor

1. **Periodic meetings** of 30 minutes will be scheduled with you during your thesis period.
2. These meetings are not compulsory; if not necessary, they should be cancelled at least a day in advance.
3. Each meeting should not exceed 25 minutes, but will have a 30-minute slot.
4. **Tentative agenda:**
    - **First 5 minutes:**
        - Discuss thesis problem, goals, timeline, etc.
        - Review previous action points: Have they been addressed? What is your current challenge?
    - **Next 15 minutes:** Technical discussion
    - **Next 5 minutes:** List your action points prior to the next meeting
    - **Final 5 minutes:** Any Other Business (AOB)
5. Extended meetings can be set up for in-depth technical discussions as needed.

**Language Consistency:**
- Use either British or American English consistently
- Write clear and unambiguous English
- Use proper articles (a, an, the) before nouns

**Logical Connectives:**
Understand the difference between:
- **Because** (B â‡’ A): "A because B"

  - "Power management-strategy" (power is adjective of management strategy)

### **Figures and Graphics**

**Figure Requirements:**
- Every figure must be referred to in text
- Explain why figure is included and what it shows
- Use unbreakable spaces: `Figure~\ref{fig:tradeoff}`
- Use meaningful labels: `\label{fig:tradeoff}`, `\label{sec:introduction}`

### **Version Control and File Naming**

**Version Numbering:**
- Use version numbers in all documents: `filename_v1.suffix` or `YYYY-MM-DD-filename.suffix`
- Ensure filenames sort correctly (older documents first)
- Choose meaningful names for others

**European Project Naming Convention:**
```
<date>_<document title>_<version>_<partner>.<extension>
```

**Examples:**
- `2009-03-04_INDEXYS_project-handbook_v1-0.pdf`
